# ðŸŽ“ Admission Predictor

## About

**Admission Predictor** is a machine learning web application that estimates the probability of university admission based on academic and research credentials. Built with Python and Streamlit, it features both an interactive front-end and a modular backend for model training, evaluation, and visualization. The tool supports fast experimentation and clear interpretability using regression models and feature importance diagnostics.

## Features

- **ðŸ”˜ Interactive Web App**  
  Launch `AdmissionApp.py` to access a Streamlit-based interface where users can upload data, generate predictions, and view visualizations.

- **ðŸ§  Model Training & Evaluation**  
  `AdmissionClassifier.py` trains and evaluates models using the data in `admissions_data.csv`. It supports regression models such as Random Forest and Linear Regression.

- **ðŸ“Š Visual Analytics**  
  Key diagnostic plots are generated during training:
  - `Actual vs Residual.png`
  - `Training&ValidationLoss.png`
  - `Training&ValidationMAE.png`
  - `Feature Importances.png`

- **ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing**  
  Built-in preprocessing using `Pandas` and `NumPy`, including feature scaling and automatic train/test splitting.

- **ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics**  
  The model is evaluated using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - RÂ² Score  
  - Loss and MAE visualizations across training epochs

- **ðŸ§¾ Explainability**  
  Feature importance visualizations provide transparency into which input variables most affect predictions.
